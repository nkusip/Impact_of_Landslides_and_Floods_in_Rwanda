# Topic: Evaluating the Impact of Natural Disasters on Rwanda: The Case of Landslides and Floods (2021-2025).

## Questions:

1. How have landslide and flood incidents changed over the last five years in Rwanda?
2. How many people have been affected (including details on deaths, injuries, and displacements) due to landslide and flood events?
3. To what extent have people's properties been affected (houses, schools, roads, cultivated areas, etc.)?
4. What are the high-risk zones for landslides and floods in Rwanda?

Rwanda has experienced increasing cases of landslides and floods due to climate change, deforestation, unfair topography, and population pressure. The most affected areas are the Western and Northern Provinces of Rwanda. However, my capstone project will evaluate the impact of landslides and floods at the national level.

To answer the above questions, I will collect data on landslide and flood events reported over the past five years. I will also collect data on the affected persons or households, displaced or relocated households, infrastructure damages, and, if available, the extent of affected crop areas. In addition, GIS shapefiles for spatial boundaries such as country, city, districts, sectors, and population shapefiles will be collected for the spatial analysis. As a result, spatio-temporal analysis will be performed to extract significant insights from the aforementioned data.

I expect to have results showing the change of landslide and flood incidents over time, bar charts for categorical data, pie charts, possibly a map showing the spatial distribution of the above-mentioned disasters and associated high-risk zones,etc.
